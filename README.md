mkdir data
# Place your Excel files (iit_combined.xlsx, nit_combined.xlsx, etc.) in the data folder
```

4. Copy environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in the terminal)

### Docker Deployment

1. Build and run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. **Institute Preference**: Bonus points for preferred institute types
3. **Branch Preference**: Bonus points for preferred branches
4. **Distance**: Proximity bonus for nearby colleges
5. **Home State Quota**: Additional points for home state colleges
